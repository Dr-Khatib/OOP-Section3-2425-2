## 📝 Overview of the Project:
This project is about developing a **Pharmacy Inventory System** that helps pharmacy staff (Admins and Pharmacists) efficiently manage medicine inventory. The system includes features such as:
- Adding new medicines
- Updating medicine quantities
- Removing expired or unused medicine entries
- Checking and alerting for low-stock items

The system also demonstrates key object-oriented programming concepts, including:
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Class relationships (association and aggregation)
- Use of `ArrayList` for data storage
- Exception handling for better program reliability

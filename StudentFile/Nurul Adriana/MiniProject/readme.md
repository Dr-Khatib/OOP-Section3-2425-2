# üìö Library Management System ‚Äì OOP Mini Project

This OOP mini project simulates a **Library Management System** that allows users to add, remove, and borrow books using core object-oriented programming concepts such as **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, **composition**, and **exception handling**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features Implemented

- ‚úÖ Add, list, find, and remove books in a library
- ‚úÖ Borrowed book tracking for members
- ‚úÖ Custom exception for invalid or missing books
- ‚úÖ Abstract superclass `User` with subclasses `Member` and `Librarian`
- ‚úÖ Method overriding (`calculateFine()`, `displayRole()`)
- ‚úÖ Dynamic binding with polymorphism

## üß† Object-Oriented Concepts with Implementation & Code Examples

| Concept                | Implementation Summary                                                                         | Code Example                                              |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Inheritance**        | `Member` and `Librarian` are subclasses that extend the abstract superclass `User`.            | ![Inheritance Code Example](inheritance.png)              |
| **Method Overriding**  | Subclasses override methods from `User` such as `displayRole()` and `calculateFine()`.         | ![Method Overriding Code Example](methodOverriding.png)   |
| **Polymorphism**       | A `User` reference points to a `Member` or `Librarian`, allowing dynamic behavior.             | ![Polymorphism Code Example](polymorphism.png)            |
| **Dynamic Binding**    | Java decides at runtime which version of the overridden method to call.                        | ![Dynamic Binding Code Example](dynamicBinding.png)       |
| **Encapsulation**      | Class fields are private, and accessed through public methods.                                 | ![Encapsulation Code Example](encapsulation.png)          |
| **Composition**        | `LibraryCard` owns a `Member` instance. If the member is deleted, the card is affected.        | ![Composition Code Example](composition.png)              |
| **Association**        | `Library` can be associated with a `Librarian` (they can exist independently).                 | ![Association Code Example](association.png)              |
| **Aggregation**        | `Library` uses a `Librarian`, but if `Library` is deleted, `Librarian` remains intact.         | ![Aggregation Code Example](aggregation.png)              |
| **Exception Handling** | Handles input validation and custom exceptions like `BookNotFoundException` using `try-catch`. | ![Exception Handling Code Example](exceptionHandling.png) |

## About Me

Hi! I'm currently exploring the world of programming, with a special focus on Java. I'm passionate about learning how to build efficient and clean code, and I'm particularly interested in concepts like object-oriented programming, constructors, and enums. My goal is to strengthen my problem-solving skills and become confident in building real-world applications. I'm also working on mastering core Java concepts to prepare for advanced topics and potential certifications in the future.

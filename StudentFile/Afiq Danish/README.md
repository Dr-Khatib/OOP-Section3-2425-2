## About Me
Greetings! I am Afiq, a second-year student of Data Engineering program in Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. I love to work with data specifically in data visualization and coding. I am eager to learn about OOP and new programming language which is Java and I hope this course will help me to understand it more clearly and well
